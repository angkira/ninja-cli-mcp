# 2026-02-08: Model Configuration Fix

## Issue
Simple tasks failing in 0.6s with no output - model `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder-next` doesn't exist in OpenCode.

## Root Cause
OpenCode threw `ProviderModelNotFoundError` because `qwen3-coder-next` is not a valid model name.
Correct model: `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder`

## Fix
Updated `~/.ninja-mcp.env`:
- `NINJA_MODEL_QUICK`: `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder-next` → `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder`
- `NINJA_CODER_MODEL`: `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder-next` → `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder`

Restarted daemon: `ninja-daemon restart coder`

## Validation
- Simple task: 22.2s, file created ✅
- Sequential: Both steps working ✅
- Parallel: Both tasks working ✅
- Process cleanup: No orphans ✅

## Rate Limits
OpenRouter has rate limits - occasional failures expected under heavy load.
File detection has false negatives (cosmetic) - files ARE created despite "no files modified" warnings.
